if all that comes out of this is friendship

i want you to know that i will love you as a friend just as much as i would love you as a lover
because your voice will be just as calming if we are telling jokes or whispering i love you’s
your smile will stay just as bright in my eyes if it comes after kissing me or watching me make an idiot of myself
and my love will remain whether you are holding my hand or handing me a drink

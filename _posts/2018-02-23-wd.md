You have ten decades to live.

grow up a bit, grow tall a little,

learn the words, explore your world.

You are ten.



You learn to see, absorb to observe,

don’t know what though,

dont know what to…

A career is thrust upon,

a dear is trusted upon.

You are an adult.



You endure the thrust,

apprehend the shallowness

and

the hollowness of that trust.

You a grow a little, a little narrower.



You grow old, you fail to see,

overlook to observe.

Acceptance turns to habit

and

change changes to stagnation.



Spirit is born,

willing to learn,

wanting to see and observe.

The ghost of a long deceased past

is brought to you with It.

But haven’t you forgotten to see?

Ignore to observe?



Spirit grows old, with you,

but faster than you,

It’s now as tall as you,

maybe even a bit taller,

It has surrounded you,

for as long as you’ve forgotten to remember.

It leaves to search its soul.



Sorrowness now surrounds you,

Bitterness from that long forgotten past

Promptly pondering it all.



You can see again,

all the ghosts standing in front of you

of all the moments that are now behind,

All the ghosts, including yours, 

that’ll be in an year or ten.



What do you do now?

Are you in pain or is it just the way you are
<!--more-->
Are your eyes complacent or are they too deep for me 

Did someone break your heart or are you breaking mine

Are you being honest or is this how you talk

Is this who you are or would you never accept

Are you made of glass or am I seeing into a mirrorâ€¦

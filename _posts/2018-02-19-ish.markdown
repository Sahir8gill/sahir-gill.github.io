I stand here in front of a cave

The sun sets behind, dives into the sea

There’s light and there’s shade.



I stand here, pondering about my days

For I know, I may not be the same,

In the depths of the cave,

People change.



I stand here feeling the last light, burning cool,

Reliving everything I did,

I did to be here

And I cannot go back where my heart lies

For only fools retract their steps.



I stand here under the heavens

Cherishing the beauty of my path

For it must’ve been written by the heavens

My atrocious fate that I like my journey

More than my Haven



I stand here with the stars and moon

Trying to appreciate their beauty 

For they will guide me now

Till the sun rises again

and we, like Brothers, shall walk thereupon.



I stand here no more

Realising that I cannot stand forever

For time goes on and so must I.

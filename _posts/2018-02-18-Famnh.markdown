Two rocks clashed and sparked

They lit the woods and they jarred

He watched in awe as he’d starred

His own heaven that he’d freshly barred.

In that moment, everything changed.



That evening in the rain

Flew a few planes

Setting the guns and bombs ablaze

Spilling blood down the drain.

In that moment, everything changed.



For aeons, It had burned

Silently, alone, It turned

From yellow to red

Just like a dream from someone’s bed

It exploded and annihilated everything in sight.

A  few moments passed;

For a moment, nothing happened.

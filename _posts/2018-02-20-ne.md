Escaping to a vacation from life,
<!--more-->
Running to gain new experiences,

Hopping under the blue skies,

Leaning towards the sea full of zeal,

Facing the air gush towards you,

on you,

through you,

Smiling,

Hanging from an invisible noose from heaven,

Setting your sight free,

Letting it run till the end of the world from this height.



<br>Thinking this is what its about,

Feeling that you can fly,

Knowing that you have to jump,

Grinning,

Letting go of everything,

Bursting is the happiness in your soul,

Falling faster every minute, faster each second,

Realising that only a few left.



Crashing on the surface, hard,

Facing the blue, rock as earth

Hardening the reality into your head

Excruciating,

The realisation, not the fall.



Regretting the bliss in that beauty?

Ebbing,

Dawning upon you,

Wondering if it was worth it,

New Experiences.

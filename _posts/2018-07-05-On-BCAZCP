A series of papers by Dalal and Govil some the theme of bounding regions containing all the zeros of a complex polynomial makes it clear on the way to progress in the same direction. An important theorem in this regard is presented in one of their papers: [this](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2013.02.073){:target="_blank"}. It comments on the nature of sequence that can be used to bound said region. All that was needed next was to find such sequences such that a non-redundant bound can be modelled. This is precisely what is done in this [paper](http://www.m-hikari.com/ijma/ijma-2018/ijma-5-8-2018/p/gillIJMA5-8-2018.pdf){:target="_blank"}

The Sendov Conjecture talks about location of critical points in relation of zeros of a polynomial, specifically of those polynomials whose zeros lie within the disk of unit radius centred at origin of the Argand plane. It claims that the critical points (zeros of derivative) of a polynomial, whose zeros lie within the unit disk centred at origin, lie within a unit disk constructed about any arbitrary zero of the polynomial. 
\
\
\
To reduce the search region of critical points of the given polynomial, a powerful result given by Gauss can be applied, according to which: All the critical points of a polynomial must lie in the region where all the zeros of the polynomial are. So the critical points must be within the unit disk.

The classical theorem of Grace states that if two polynomials are apolar, then the roots of one polynomial lie in the same region as roots of the other.

In this project, the conjecture was attempted to be proven by the idea that if the derivative polynomial can be forced to be apolar for every given polynomial which obeys the condition for the result by Sendov, i.e. if the apolarity condition always has a solution, then the conjecture is true. In this project, other similar possibilities are also discussed.

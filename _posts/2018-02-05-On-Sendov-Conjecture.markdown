The Sendov Conjecture talks about location of critical points in relation of zeros of a polynomial, specifically of those polynomials whose zeros lie within the disk of unit radius centred at origin of the Argand plane. It claims that the critical points (zeros of derivative) of a polynomial, whose zeros lie within the unit disk centred at origin, lie within a unit disk constructed about any arbitrary zero of the polynomial.

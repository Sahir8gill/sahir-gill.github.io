i don’t think i feel that numbers are real
<!--more-->
they flow as if they’re inside me
coming from my deepest corners
they’re one of our wildest imaginations
and the stories we write
and the novels we read
trapping them in a box
letting them free
on a roller coaster of themselves
finding them important
and not so much
in that world which is a part of ours
and independent
are they free?
with as many laws as themselves
to govern them
to have so many rules
is as if to have none at all

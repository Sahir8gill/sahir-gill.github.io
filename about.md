I'm a final year undergraduate of Electrical & Electronics Engineering at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani: K.K. Birla Goa Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/index.aspx "Institute Homepage"){:target="_blank"}.

While majoring in engineering, I have also studied a few mathematics courses, details of which can be found [here]({{ sahir8gill.github.io }}/assets/List of Math Courses.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Subsequently, I have worked as the Teacher's Assistance for the following math course:

| Course        | Year          | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Mathematics I (Multivariable Calculus)      | Fall '18 |
| Mathematics II (Linear Algebra & Complex Analysis)      | Spring '18     |
| Calculus (Work Integrated Learning Program) | Fall '17      |


As of August 2018, I am also involved in working towards the upliftment of the economically challenged community around campus by providing educational assistance to children living there on a bi-weekly basis. This project is undertaken by [Nirmaan](https://www.facebook.com/goanirmaan/ "Facebook Page"){:target="_blank"} and I specifically work under Project Lamani.
